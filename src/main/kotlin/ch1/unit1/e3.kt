    /*
    If this function is like a verb, then "Text" is like a noun. In programming it called "value".
    So, above call function "println" and pass value "Text" to it for printing on the console.

    You may use different types of values.
    In Kotlin, "Text" is a value of String type.

    println(1)
    // Numbers without "." are integer numbers. In mathematics they called whole numbers.
    // 1 is a value of Int type

    println(3.14)
    // Numbers with "." are floating point numbers. In mathematics they called decimals.
    // There are two types of floating numbers in Kotlin: Float and Double.
    // For know, you can always use Double. Kotlin see any number with "." as a value of Double type.

    /*
    String, Int and Double are called types or classes.
    Term "type" is more appropriate when we talk about something simple, like a number.
    Term "class" is better when we talk about something more complex. You see it later.
    When whe use a value of some comlex type we call it "object".

    String, Int and Double are predefined types in Kotlin.
    println is a predefined function.
    Kotlin allows to define additional types/classes and pack it into a library.

    Type/Class of a value defines what this value can contain and what you can do with it.
