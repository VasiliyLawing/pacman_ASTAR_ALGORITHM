 All our examples will have such a standard template:
 package <chapter>.<section>

 fun main() {
   // You write your own code here
 }
*/

// Here is a simple example
fun main() {
  // You can write comments like this. Everything from '//' until end of the line will be a comment

  /*
    You can write comments like this. This way you can make multiline comments.
    Kotlin just ignore your comments.

  // use "println" to print something on console
  // string should be in double quotes

  println("Hello")

  // If you uncomment this line and comment you the previous println line.
  // Find out what the difference between prinln() and print()
  //print("Hello")

  println("Something else")
}
