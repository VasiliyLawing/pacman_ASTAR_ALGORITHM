/*
 All our examples will have such a standard template:
 package <chapter>.<section>.
 chapter and section are just names to refer to.

 fun main() {
   // You write your own code here
 }
*/

// Here is a simple example
fun main() {
    // You can write comments like this. Everything from '//' until end of the line will be a comment

    /*
      You also can write comments like this. This way you can make multiline comments.
      Kotlin just ignores your comments.
    */

    // use "println" to print something on console
    // Text you printing should be in double quotes

    println("Hello")

    // If you uncomment this line and comment you the previous println line.
    // Find out what the difference between println() and print()
    print("Hello2")

    println("Something else")
}
