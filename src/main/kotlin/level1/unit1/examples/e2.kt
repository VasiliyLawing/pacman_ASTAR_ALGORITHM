/*
For now, we think about a program as a sequence of command.
Computer executes the commands one after another.
Later, you will see another ways to think about program.

Use debugger to see how computes executes these three commands step by step.

This particular type of command called "function call". "println" is the name of the function.
To call a function means to execute it.

You call any function by writing its name then its arguments separated by coma enclosed in () braces.
Function println takes only one argument or no arguments. In this example the text we want to print is the argument.

You may see functions like verbs in programming language.

fun main() {
    println("Command1")
    println("Command2")
    println("Command3")
}
